# qb-vehiclekeys
Vehicle Keys System For QB-Core

# VT Development's editing 1.0.3
 - [ ] Removed the search for keys or more mentioned as Hotwire
 - [ ] Added car smash minigame.
 - [ ] When you go up to get the keys, you have to play again to get them. Note that until you break her, she will not stop, you can do it however you want according to your taste.
 - [ ] We have changed the style completely like the original NoPixel 3.5
 - [ ] It also works with the latest version of qb-core
 - [ ] Note that this is not the latest version of qb-vehiclekeys from qbcore. We don't like the new NUI of the new version and so we prefer to stay on the older version.

# Introduction
  > Handles the logic of locking/lockpicking and robbing cars
  > (Uses  for the lockpicking minigame) - This is no longer necessary. The mini game is integrated directly to the resource!
  > Aim a gun at a ped driver for a chance to rob their keys

# Configuration
   ## General
